# School_District_Analysis
# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to help Maria analyze data on student funding and students standardized test scores.
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Maria has asked us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.
